WELCOME

----------
PATH_FINDER
----------

To run the file, head to 'game.rb' and and change/uncomment which algorithm you want to run in 'if __FILE__....'

once you run 'ruby game.rb' -
The program will run a path finder in the terminal, with some visualizations of the algorithm behind it. 

The goal of this project is to work on understanding how certain algorithms work, then eventual translate all of the code 
to javascript and then make a frontend using react. 
I also want to have a sudoku solver with visuals as well, and a chess AI visualizer.
